/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset defines access control for a portfolio application's data.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model prioritizes simplicity and ease of management for a portfolio application
 * with limited collaborative features. Data is stored in root-level collections without complex
 * user-based authorization. Public read access is enabled for all collections. Write access is
 * forbidden to prevent unauthorized data modification.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /projects/{projectId}: Stores project information.
 * - /illustrations/{illustrationId}: Stores illustration information.
 * - /contactInfo/{contactInfoId}: Stores contact information.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access: All collections are publicly readable, allowing any user to view the portfolio content.
 * - Write restrictions: All write operations (create, update, delete) are denied to prevent unauthorized data modification.
 * - No user listing: There are no user-related collections or operations in this application.
